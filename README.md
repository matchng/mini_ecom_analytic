# Mini E-commerce Analytics Project

## Description
This project simulates a real-world data engineering workflow using synthetic (non-sensitive) e-commerce sales data. It showcases the end-to-end process of ingesting, storing, and visualizing data with PostgreSQL, pgAdmin, Metabase, and Docker.

## Project Goals

The objective is to gain hands-on, practical experience with key tools in the modern data engineering stack by recreating a simplified version of a data pipeline. This project is part of my personal learning journey to reinforce concepts learned from DataCamp and LinkedIn Learning.

| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **PostgreSQL**              | Relational database used to store structured e-commerce data                                                      |
| **pgAdmin**                 | Web-based GUI tool to interact with and manage the PostgreSQL database                                            |
| **Metabase**                | Data visualization tool used for data exploration and building dashboards                                         |
| **Docker & Docker Compose** | Containerized setup to run PostgreSQL, pgAdmin, and Metabase in isolated, reproducible environments               |
| **SQL**                     | Used for data transformation, aggregation and analysis                                                            |

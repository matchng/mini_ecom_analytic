# Mini E-commerce Analytics Project

## Description
This project simulates a real-world data engineering workflow using synthetic (non-sensitive) e-commerce sales data. It showcases the end-to-end process of ingesting, storing, and visualizing data with PostgreSQL, pgAdmin, Metabase, and Docker.

## Project Goals

The objective is to gain hands-on, practical experience with key tools in the modern data engineering stack by recreating a simplified version of a data pipeline. This project is part of my personal learning journey to reinforce concepts learned from DataCamp and LinkedIn Learning.
